Predicting Student Dropout: A Machine Learning Approach

This project predicts which students are most likely to drop out of school based on a variety of features, including their academic performance and personal characteristics. Using the Student Performance dataset from Kaggle, this project employs machine learning classification models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify students at risk. The project involves data cleaning, model building, and evaluation.

Key Features:
 • Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, transforming categorical variables into numerical format, and scaling features.
 • Model Building: Logistic Regression and SVM are used for classification, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
 • Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, Jaccard score, and confusion matrices.
 • Visualization: Confusion matrix visualization to better understand model performance.

Technologies Used:
 • Python
 • Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
 • Scikit-learn
